# Email

## About

A library to send an email and create template that wraps:
  * SimpleJavaMail
  * gmail API (client credentials are in the resources)

Jakarta Mail is only a test runtime dependency (ie gradle api) and is not added in the path
because every web framework has its own email module (ie vertx has a non-blocking email module for instance)

## Jakarta

Dependencies: Jakarta the new mail api needs Angus SMTPTransport
ie `com.sun.mail.smtp.SMTPTransport` is now `org.eclipse.angus.mail.smtp.SMTPTransport`
See https://eclipse-ee4j.github.io/angus-mail/

## Template

There is a collection of template in the resources directory.


# Test

We are using [Wiser](https://github.com/voodoodyne/subethasmtp/blob/master/src/main/java/org/subethamail/wiser/Wiser.java)

It starts a fake SMTP server and let us get the email back.

At the same time, the test will also send an email to a local SMTP port server with GUI. The port is 25 which
is the default of [Papercut](https://github.com/ChangemakerStudios/Papercut-SMTP/releases)
