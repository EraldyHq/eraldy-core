## Protector

A cipher text of the [protector](../src/main/java/net/bytle/crypto/Protector.java) has the following structure:
  * base64 of the bytes of a string (this is to delete the base64 separator)
  * when we decode the base64, we get a string with two parts separated by the `>` separator
    * the first part is a byte that contains the id of the cipher transformation
    * the second part is the output of the cipher transformation
  * We give the second part to the cipher transformation, and we get back the plain text

As today, we use only a `AES` transformation in the [symmetric cipher](../src/main/java/net/bytle/crypto/CryptoSymmetricCipher.java)
  * It creates as output a string composed of three `base64` strings separated by the `>` separator
  * the three parts are the salt, the hmac and the ciphertext

## Wrapper Around Bouncy Castle


* https://www.bouncycastle.org/java.html for the Aergon Algo for password based encryption


Not [Tink](https://developers.google.com/tink/) because it [does not support password based encryption](https://github.com/google/tink/issues/121))
